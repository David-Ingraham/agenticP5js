1. Structural Similarity (SSIM)
ON: Use SSIM scoring for luminance, contrast, and structure matching
OFF: Skip structural analysis
Purpose: Catch layout and brightness issues that LLM might miss
2. Perceptual Distance (LPIPS)
ON: Apply deep learning-based perceptual similarity scoring
OFF: Rely on traditional metrics only
Purpose: Human-like visual perception evaluation
3. Color Palette Analysis
ON: Extract and match dominant colors between target and generated
OFF: Skip color distribution analysis
Purpose: Ensure color accuracy beyond just individual pixel matching
4. Edge Detection Similarity
ON: Compare structural edge patterns and line work
OFF: Skip edge-based analysis
Purpose: Focus on shape accuracy and line quality
5. Composition Balance Analysis
ON: Evaluate visual weight distribution and rule-of-thirds compliance
OFF: Skip compositional analysis
Purpose: Assess artistic composition quality
