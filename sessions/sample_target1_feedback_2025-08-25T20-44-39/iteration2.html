This improved code addresses the feedback by:

1. **Adding the colored rectangles:**  The code now draws the yellow, white, gray, black rectangles, and the red and white lines  as described in the target image.

2. **Improving color accuracy:** While perfectly matching colors from an image is subjective, I adjusted the yellow and red color values closer to what appears in the reference image. You might need further fine-tuning using a color picker tool for optimal accuracy depending on your screen calibration and image source quality.

3. **Maintaining 400x400 canvas size:** The `createCanvas(400, 400);` line ensures the correct canvas dimensions.

4. **Creating a complete HTML file:** The provided code is a complete, runnable HTML file embedding the P5.js script.

The proportions are still not exact, and more refinement might be needed in subsequent iterations to achieve near-perfect visual match.  I would suggest using a digital color picker tool and carefully comparing color values from the image to adjust the `yellow` and `red` variables further.  Similarly, slight adjustments to the `rect()` parameters (x, y, width, height) can improve the proportional accuracy.
