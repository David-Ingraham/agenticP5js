Here's attempt 1 of recreating the image using p5.js.  This attempt focuses on getting the basic shapes and colors correct.  Further attempts will refine the color accuracy and proportions.

let yellow = color(255, 204, 0); //Approximate yellow color
let gray = color(128, 128, 128); //Approximate gray color
let red = color(204,0,0); //Approximate Red color

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  noLoop(); // Static image
}

function draw() {
  // Yellow Rectangle
  fill(yellow);
  rect(0, 0, 200, 200);

  // White Rectangle
  fill(255);
  rect(200, 0, 200, 200);

  //Thin white line
  fill(255);
  rect(200, 100, 200, 10);

  //Grey Rectangle
  fill(gray);
  rect(0, 200, 200, 200);

  //Black Rectangle
  fill(0);
  rect(200, 200, 200, 200);

  //Red Line
  fill(red);
  rect(200, 190, 200, 10);

  //Thin white line
  fill(255);
  rect(0, 190, 200, 10);

This code creates the basic structure.  The next iterations will focus on:

* **More precise color matching:** Using color pickers to obtain exact RGB or HEX values from the target image.
* **Accurate proportions:** Refining the sizes and positions of the rectangles to match the original more closely.
* **Adding subtle details:**  The original image might have slight variations in color or shading that need to be incorporated for higher fidelity.


I await your feedback and will proceed with further attempts based on your evaluation.
