This version makes the following key improvements:

* **More accurate yellow:** The yellow color is adjusted to be closer to the target image's yellow.  Further fine-tuning might still be needed depending on your display.
* **Black border:** A black border is added around the entire canvas using a slightly larger rectangle drawn behind the colored rectangles.  The coordinates are adjusted by -1 to create a 1px border.  A `stroke()` approach could also be considered for a thinner border.
* **No other changes are needed:** The previous code already correctly placed and sized the rectangles to match the target image's composition.


Remember that perfect color matching can be challenging due to variations in screen calibration and image source quality. Use a color picker tool to sample colors directly from the target image for optimal results.  The small differences remaining might be due to these factors, rather than code issues.
