  "analysis": "**Differences:**\n\n1. **Overlapping Circles Group Position and Size:** The overlapping circles (blue, red, yellow, white) are positioned too high and to the right.  In the target, the blue circle's center is approximately at (490, 325) with a diameter of ~55px.  The current code places them around (490, 290) with a diameter of 45px.  The red arc also needs to be a larger portion of a circle.\n2. **Line Positions and Angles:**  The lines are close but not precisely aligned with the target image. For instance, the line from the lower-left should intersect the green circle and the lower part of the purple circle group. The angles and endpoints need further adjustment.\n3. **Colored Squares Group Position and Size:** The group of colored squares is too small and slightly too high and to the right.  In the target, the squares appear to be approximately 25x25 pixels each, and the group is positioned around (540, 100). The current code uses 20x20 pixel squares at (530, 80).\n\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n- **Overlapping Circles and Arcs:**\n```javascript\n    let baseX = 490;\n    let baseY = 325;\n    let baseDiameter = 55;\n\n    // Blue Circle\n    fill('#0000FF');\n    circle(baseX, baseY, baseDiameter);\n\n    // Red semi-circle  (Increased arc size)\n    fill('#FF0000');\n    arc(baseX - baseDiameter * 0.5, baseY, baseDiameter, baseDiameter, -PI/4, 3*PI/4);\n\n    // Yellow circle (adjusted size and position)\n    fill('#FFFF00');\n    circle(baseX + baseDiameter * 0.5, baseY - baseDiameter * 0.2, baseDiameter * 0.7);\n\n    // White circle (adjusted size and position)\n    fill('#FFFFFF');\n    circle(baseX + baseDiameter * 0.3, baseY - baseDiameter * 0.4, baseDiameter * 0.4);\n```\n\n- **Line Positions and Angles (more precise adjustments):**\n```javascript\n    strokeWeight(3);\n    line(60, 280, 380, 210); // Adjusted\n    line(570, 70, 150, 505);   // Adjusted\n    line(5, 430, 280, 65);   // Adjusted\n```\n\n- **Colored Squares Group:**\n```javascript\n    let rectX = 540;\n    let rectY = 100;\n    let rectSize = 25;\n\n    fill('#FF0000');\n    rect(rectX, rectY, rectSize, rectSize);\n    fill('#7F00FF');\n    rect(rectX + rectSize, rectY, rectSize, rectSize);\n    fill('#FFFF00');\n    rect(rectX, rectY + rectSize, rectSize, rectSize);\n    fill('#0000FF');\n    rect(rectX + rectSize, rectY + rectSize, rectSize, rectSize);\n```\n\nThese changes aim to address the identified differences with more specific pixel adjustments based on visual inspection of the target image.  Continue to refine the values if necessary to achieve perfect alignment and sizing.  Pay close attention to the angles and intersection points of the lines.  If you have a tool for selecting colors from images, use it for precise color matching.  Finally, always test after every code modification.",
