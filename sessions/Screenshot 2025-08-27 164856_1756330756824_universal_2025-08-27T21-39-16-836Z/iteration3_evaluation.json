  "feedback": "**Differences:**\n\n1. **Yellow Rectangle Size and Position:** The yellow rectangle in the target image is 270px wide and 30px high, located at approximately x: 140, y: 60.  The current code creates a rectangle that is 310px wide and 50px high, located at x: 120, y: 0.\n2. **Blue Shape Size and Position:** The blue shape is significantly different. It's smaller and placed higher in the target image. The angles and vertices are also incorrect in the current code.  The target image shows a shape closer to a quadrilateral rather than the current five-sided shape.\n3. **Orange Rectangles Size, Position, and Number:** The target image has two distinct orange rectangles. The current code generates two overlapping rectangles which look like one larger rectangle.  Their sizes and positions in the current code are also inaccurate compared to the target.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n- **Change Yellow Rectangle:** Replace the yellow rectangle code with:\n```javascript\nfill('#FFDA00'); // Correct yellow color\nrect(140, 60, 270, 30); // Adjusted position and size\n```\n\n- **Change Blue Shape:** Replace the blue shape code with:\n```javascript\nfill('#1959B3'); // Correct blue color\nbeginShape();\nvertex(140, 90);\nvertex(410, 90);\nvertex(430, 170);\nvertex(140, 200);\nendShape(CLOSE);\n```\n\n- **Change Orange Rectangles:**  Replace the orange rectangle code with the following to create two separate rectangles:\n```javascript\nfill('#E8790C'); // Correct orange color\nrect(410, 90, 30, 110); // Rightmost orange rectangle\n\nfill('#E8790C'); // Correct orange color\nrect(320, 90, 90, 110); // Left orange rectangle\n\n```\n",
