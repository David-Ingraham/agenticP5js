Currently, it's at x: 140, y: 150, width: 240px, and height: 20px.\n2. **Incorrect Blue Shape Dimensions and Shape:** The blue shape is an irregular quadrilateral.  Currently, it's represented as a simpler quadrilateral with incorrect vertices.  The correct shape needs to be defined with more precision.\n3. **Incorrect Orange Rectangle Dimensions and Position:** The orange rectangle should be wider and integrated with the blue shape, not simply adjacent. Currently, it's at x: 380, y: 170, width: 50px, height: 110px. Its dimensions and position need adjustments for proper overlapping with the blue area.\n4. **Incorrect Green Rectangle Dimensions and Position:** The green rectangle starts too high. It should begin at a lower y-coordinate to align properly with the bottom of the blue and orange shapes. Currently at y: 280, it needs to be lowered.  Its width also needs adjusting.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n- **Change Yellow Rectangle:** Replace `rect(140, 150, 240, 20);` with `rect(130, 140, 260, 40);`\n- **Change Blue and Orange Shapes:** Replace the current blue and orange shapes with a more accurate representation. This requires drawing a custom shape using `beginShape()` and `vertex()` with accurate coordinates, or pre-calculating those coordinates:\n\n```javascript\nfill('#1959B3');\nbeginShape();\nvertex(130, 180);\nvertex(390, 180);\nvertex(410, 220); // Adjust these points for a more accurate curve\nvertex(410, 300);\nvertex(130, 300);\nendShape(CLOSE);\n\nfill('#E8790C');\nbeginShape(); // Integrate the orange shape into the blue shape's drawing\nvertex(390, 180);\nvertex(440, 180);  // Extend further to the right\nvertex(440, 300);  // Extend down to align with the bottom of the blue shape\nvertex(410, 300);\nvertex(410, 220); // Connect back to the blue shape\nendShape(CLOSE);\n\n\n```\n\n\n- **Change Green Rectangle:** Replace `rect(140, 280, 260, 152);` with `rect(130, 300, 310, 222);` This adjusts the position and width of the green rectangle to match the target image more closely. Ensure the bottom edge aligns with the bottom of the canvas.  This might require slight adjustments to y and height values depending on the exact heights of the blue/orange complex shape.\n\n\n\nThese changes will bring the generated image significantly closer to the target image by addressing the key differences in shape, position, size, and color.  Further refinement may be needed by carefully comparing and adjusting individual vertex coordinates in the blue/orange area.\n",
