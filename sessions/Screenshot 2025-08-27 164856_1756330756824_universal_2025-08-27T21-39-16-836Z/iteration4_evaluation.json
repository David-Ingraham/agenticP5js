The current code places it at x: 140, y: 60 with dimensions of 270x30 pixels.\n2. **Blue Shape:**  The blue shape in the target is smaller and doesn't extend as far down or to the right. Its bottom left vertex is higher than in the current code. The orange shape overlaps it significantly.\n3. **Orange Shape:** The orange shape in the target is a single rectangle that extends from roughly x: 380, y:170 to  x:430, y: 280. The current code has two separate orange rectangles, neither correctly positioned or sized. The orange rectangle is located entirely to the right of the blue shape whereas the target shows a substantial overlap of the orange and blue.\n4. **Missing Green Rectangle:** The target image includes a large green rectangle at the bottom that is absent in the current code.\n\n\n\n**Instructions:**\n- **Change Yellow Rectangle:** Change the `rect` function for the yellow rectangle to `rect(140, 150, 240, 20);`\n- **Change Blue Shape and Introduce Overlap:** Reshape the blue quadrilateral using these adjusted vertices and introduce the overlap:\n```javascript\n    fill('#1959B3');\n    beginShape();\n    vertex(140, 170); // Adjusted Y\n    vertex(380, 170); // Adjusted X and Y for overlap\n    vertex(400, 280); // Adjusted X and Y\n    vertex(140, 280); // Adjusted Y\n    endShape(CLOSE);\n```\n- **Change Orange Rectangle:**  Change the code to draw a *single* orange rectangle:\n```javascript\n    fill('#E8790C');\n    rect(380, 170, 50, 110);  // Single rectangle with adjusted position and size.\n```\n- **Add Green Rectangle:** Add the following code after the orange rectangle:\n```javascript\n    fill('#008000'); // Green\n    rect(140, 280, 260, 152); // Approximate position and size\n```\n\n\nRevised Code:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.4.0/lib/p5.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n<script>\nfunction setup() {\n    createCanvas(520, 522);\n    noLoop();\n}\nfunction draw() {\n    background('#27408B');\n    fill('#FFDA00');\n    rect(140, 150, 240, 20); // Corrected\n\n    fill('#1959B3');\n    beginShape();\n    vertex(140, 170); // Adjusted\n    vertex(380, 170); // Adjusted\n    vertex(400, 280); // Adjusted\n    vertex(140, 280); // Adjusted\n    endShape(CLOSE);\n\n    fill('#E8790C');\n    rect(380, 170, 50, 110); // Corrected\n\n    fill('#008000'); // Green\n    rect(140, 280, 260, 152); // Added\n}\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n```\nThis revised code incorporates the specific changes, improving the accuracy of the recreation.  Further minor adjustments might be necessary depending on the precise pixel requirements of the target image.  You can use a tool like a pixel ruler on a screenshot to get very precise measurements.  This detailed breakdown with specific coordinates and adjustments will help achieve a much closer match to the target image.\n",
