  "feedback": "**Differences:**\n\n1. **Bottom Green Rectangle:** The generated image's green rectangle starts at y=418 and is 104px tall.  The target image's green rectangle starts at y=422 and is 100px tall.  The color is also slightly off.\n2. **Orange Quadrilateral:** The generated image has an orange quadrilateral on the left side. It shouldn't be there. The target image's orange areas are different shapes and sizes.\n3. **Yellow Rectangle/Quadrilateral:** The generated image's yellow areas are misaligned, incorrectly sized, and partially overlapped by other shapes. The target image has distinct yellow rectangles at  x=100, y=0 (320x50) and x=270, y=50 (150x230).\n4. **White/Blue Triangle/Quadrilateral:** The positioning and sizes of the white triangle and the overlying blue quadrilateral are inaccurate in the generated image. The shapes need adjustments to match the target. The target image's white triangle vertices are approximately at (130,50), (260, 210), and (130,230). The overlying blue quadrilateral needs to fit exactly over a portion of the white triangle to create the desired effect.\n5. **Orange Ellipse:** The generated image's orange ellipse is too small, and slightly misplaced. The target image's ellipse is larger and at x=195, y=130, with a width and height of approximately 30px.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n- **Correct Green Rectangle:** Change the fill to `#009688` and the `quad()` coordinates to `quad(0, 422, 520, 422, 520, 522, 0, 522);`. This ensures correct color, height, and placement.\n- **Remove Orange Quadrilateral:** Delete the line `quad(0, 418, 130, 418, 130, 522, 0, 522);` It's not present in the target. Add a new orange quadrilateral with `fill('#D35400'); quad(0, 230, 130, 50, 130, 230, 0, 280);`\n- **Adjust Yellow Shapes:** Change the first yellow `rect()` to `rect(100, 0, 320, 50);`.  Change the yellow `quad()` to `quad(270, 50, 420, 50, 420, 280, 270, 280);`\n- **Correct White/Blue Shapes:**  Change the white triangle to `triangle(130, 50, 260, 210, 130, 230);`.  Change the blue `quad()` overlaying the triangle to `quad(130, 50, 270, 50, 270, 230, 130, 230);`. This adjusts both shapes to the correct proportions and positioning.\n- **Correct Orange Ellipse:** Change the ellipse to `ellipse(195, 130, 30, 30);` This positions and sizes the ellipse correctly.\n\n\nRevised Code:\n\n```javascript\nfunction setup() {\n    createCanvas(520, 522);\n    noLoop();\n}\n\nfunction draw() {\n    background('#2196F3');\n    fill('#FFC107');\n    rect(100, 0, 320, 50);\n    fill('#D35400');\n    quad(0, 230, 130, 50, 130, 230, 0, 280); //Orange Shape Correction\n    fill('#FFFFFF');\n    triangle(130, 50, 260, 210, 130, 230);\n    fill('#2196F3');\n    quad(130, 50, 270, 50, 270, 230, 130, 230);\n    fill('#FFC107');\n    quad(270, 50, 420, 50, 420, 280, 270, 280);    \n    fill('#009688');\n    quad(0, 422, 520, 422, 520, 522, 0, 522); //Corrected Green Rectangle\n    fill('#D35400');\n    ellipse(195, 130, 30, 30); //Corrected Orange Ellipse\n}\n```\n",
