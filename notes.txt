save every code file the agent create along with a screenshot, so long as the code compliies and the image is not empty. the agent shoudl 
be prompted to itterate untill i thinks it has a good image. it will know that its final image output wil be jsuged by another ai just on its visual 
differecne to the objective. 


things to vary between studies.


how much does the agent know baout the process?
the similarity scroe threshold 


user cna change prompts for eithe rmodel but are restricted to a certain number of charecters 


the scond llm would only give three changes as feedback as of now, we need it to list every difference. 

designing the defeault prompts 


letting the model write its ownimage processing code on the fly per image 

no white list commands just give it a vm to destory 

do i just give it a shell and let it rip ? 


focus on giving it exmaples of other p5js projects

can we let it do a reverse image search? a lot of thes programatic art things 
are visualizations of famous algorthims, let empower the agent to use reverse image search 
and possibly be able to get the algo for the art 

can we tell the ai how many lines the code is that made the image? 


with each new tool toggled on, auto adjust the prompt to tell the model about the 
tools and what it shoudl use them for. see if they can do a reverse image lookup, find the algorithm it is using to make the image. 
dont tell them its p5js gernerated 


toggle to give them model reverse image look up tools and acess to js image analysis
libraries. 

 do a shell on isolated vm AND just white list npm instal {libs from file}
